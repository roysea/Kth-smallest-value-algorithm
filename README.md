# Kth-smallest-value-algorithm
In this project I compared compare the time complexity of finding the kth smallest value in an array using the following 4 different partitioning algorithms.

1. Select-Kth1 Merge sort

2. Select-Kth2 Quick sort --iterative mode

3. Select-Kth3 Quick sort --recursive mode

4. Select-Kth4 Median of medians
